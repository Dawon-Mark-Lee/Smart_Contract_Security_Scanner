A comprehensive web-based security analysis tool for Solidity smart contracts. This tool helps developers identify common vulnerabilities and security issues in their smart contracts before deployment.
🌟 Features

Advanced Vulnerability Detection: Detects 22+ different types of security vulnerabilities
Real-time Analysis: Instant feedback on contract security
Risk Assessment: Comprehensive risk scoring and categorization
Export Reports: Generate detailed security reports in Markdown format
Sample Contracts: Pre-loaded examples including vulnerable and secure contracts
Gas Impact Analysis: Understanding of gas implications for each vulnerability
Category Classification: Organized by security categories (Access Control, MEV Protection, etc.)
