🏆 Recognition
We appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Contributors who report valid security issues will be:

Credited in security advisories (with permission)
Listed in project acknowledgments
Invited to test fixes before public release

📜 Legal

Good faith security research is encouraged
We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow responsible disclosure
Please respect user privacy and data protection laws
Do not access data that doesn't belong to you

🔐 Cryptographic Considerations
This tool does not implement custom cryptography but relies on:

Browser-standard crypto APIs
No key generation or management
No encryption of user data
Standard HTTPS for any external resources

🎓 Security Education
We believe in security education and encourage:

Learning about smart contract vulnerabilities
Understanding common attack vectors
Practicing secure development habits
Sharing knowledge with the community


Remember: Automated tools are helpful but not sufficient. Always combine multiple analysis methods and get professional audits for production smart contracts.
